### Section III: PM/TL Turnover

1. The process of PM and TL evaluation and turnover, to be carried out at the end of each semester, is as follows: 
	1. Each PM and TL’s team members provide written feedback about their PM and TL. The Projects Chair is responsible for crafting and handling the distribution of the feedback form.
	2. After all feedback forms have been received, the current Projects Chair and current Co-Directors (“the evaluative committee”) meet to evaluate the current PMs and TLs. With the exception of the Projects Chair (at the end of a Fall semester) or the Projects Chair Elect (at the end of a Spring semester), all PMs and TLs are reconsidered for the following semester. In the event that one or two of the three members of the evaluative committee are themselves running to be a PM or TL, one or two seniors, respectively, will be nominated and elected to the evaluative committee. The evaluation should include, but is not limited to, consideration of the following kinds of feedback:
		1. Current team members’ evaluations of their PM or TL.
		2. Feedback given by PMs, TLs, and/or Co-Directors after sitting in on other PMs and TLs’ meetings.
		3. Projects Chair’s interactions with each PM and TL throughout the semester.
		4. Quality and scheduled delivery of the project.

	3. By the end of the evaluation process for the evaluative committee, each current PM and TL (except the Projects Chair or Projects Chair Elect as described above) must have been unanimously assigned either a ‘Yes’ or a ‘Maybe’ by the evaluative committee. (The former indicates that the PM or TL will definitely be eligible for a PM or TL role, respectively, for the next semester based on their performance as a PM or TL, while the latter indicates that the PM or TL should be reconsidered in a second round of evaluations.) All PMs and TLs should be notified of their status as soon as possible.
	4. If there are fewer confirmed PMs and TLs than there are projects for the following semester, interviews will be held for anyone interested in being a PM or TL. ‘Maybe’ PMs and TLs from the current semester will participate in this round of interviews. The questions used for this round of interviews will be crafted jointly by the current Projects Chair and the two Co-Directors, and the interviews will be carried out by the same group of people. The current Projects Chair is responsible for scheduling the interviews. 
	5. After PM and TL interviews have been held, the aforementioned evaluative group will convene again to evaluate the pool of potential PMs and TLs. In the case of ‘Maybe’ PMs and/or TLs, all previously-collected feedback can be considered in addition to their interview answers and potential. All PM and TL decisions must be unanimous.
	6. All potential PMs and TLs must be notified of their status for the following semester as soon as possible. 

2. If a PM or TL is underperforming and/or a PM or TL needs to take or requests a leave of absence, the following steps are taken to ensure the well-being of the PM or TL’s team members and the future of the PM or TL’s project:
	1. The Projects Chair and Co-Directors meet to discuss the future of the project. 
	2. If the Projects Chair and Co-Directors decide to continue the project despite the absence of the PM and/or TL, another Hack4Impact active or inactive member will be temporarily promoted to the role of PM or TL, respectively, for the remainder of the semester. 

3. If the PM or TL is removed for underperformance, they will be reassigned to the developer role or asked to take a semester off by near-unanimous Executive Board agreement. If the PM or TL needs to take or requests a leave of absence, they will be asked to take their probationary semester off.

### Section II: Resignations, Short Terms, and Vacancies

1. Replacement of Resigned Member (see Article VI):
	1. If the resigned member was a Co-Director:
		1. A first election will be held to replace the Co-Director. The candidate pool should only include members of the Executive Board.
		2. A second election will be held to replace the Executive Board member who replaced the Co-Director. It should include any members from the Active Body who are nominated.
	2. For resigned members that were on the Executive Board but were not Co-Directors, an election should be held which is similar in process to ordinary elections. The election process will allow any member of the club who is not a Co-Director to run for the open position(s) and will operate under the following procedure for Special Elections:
		1. Before the details of the particular Special Election are announced to the general body of the organization, a list of to-be-vacated spots will be collected. These positions are the Open Positions. At this point, any non-Co-Director member of the executive board can apply to run for any of the vacated spots.
			1. Executive board members applying immediately become the initial Elected Candidates.
				1. This ensures a member cannot outright lose their position on the executive board by running for another position.
			2. The Elected Candidate's previous positions are added to the list of Open Positions.
		2. Following this, the Open Positions are released to the general body. Any member can apply to run for the Open Positions. The application process is the same as that outlined in 5.1.2 for ordinary elections, though candidates need only submit statements and preference rankings for the Open Positions and may not submit Co-Director statements. Candidates who are currently on the executive board must also submit statements and rankings.
		3. At a Hapen or separate meeting (achieving quorum) at least one week after the release of the Open Positions, election proceedings are run, moderators chosen according to 5.1.3, as in the case of ordinary elections.
			1. In the first round, the remaining Elected Candidates are chosen such that the total number of Elected Candidates equals the number of Open Positions.
				1. Speeches will be given with time for Q&A, as determined under the procedure for ordinary general board elections, and candidates will leave the room when they are not speaking (including executive board members running for another position)
				2. After all speakers have spoken, deliberations begins. Deliberations will last 10 minutes and any club member can motion to extend them by 10 minute intervals.
				3. After deliberations, everyone returns to the room, and instant runoff voting occurs to select the remaining Elected Candidates.
				4. Finally, the final pool of Elected Candidates will be released to the club.
			2. The second round selects which Elected Candidate fills which board position.
				1. Position-specific statements and position preferences of each Elected Candidate are released to the club.
				2. 15 minutes are given to read the statements.
				3. Instant runoff voting occurs as per typical position-specific voting proceedings.
				4. The results are announced to the club and the new executive board is officially established.
			3. Any unordinary circumstances will be handled by the ordinary election procedure for general board members, as described in 5.1.7.



2. If a resigned member gives proper due notice before resigning, the member still has ability to run for Executive Board positions in the future.
3. If a resigned member abruptly departs without an acceptable reason, whether they can run for Executive Board positions in the future will be decided by near-unanimous agreement of the remaining Executive Board at the time of their resignation.

2. Short Terms
	1. A member can run to serve for only the following semester under the following conditions.
		1. That member discloses their intention to serve a short term on a 'short term declaration' form which will be distributed before elections. During elections, the election moderators will inform all members about the candidates who intend to serve short terms.
		2. Less than half of the elected board can serve short terms. In addition, at least one co-director must serve a full term. 
	2. At the end of the short term, each empty position will be filled using the aforementioned process for replacing resigned members (see 2.1.1 and 2.1.2).
